{"title":"The Natural History Museum in London opens its online doors","description":"<p>Home to over 80 million specimens from across the globe, the Natural History Museum is on a constant mission to make its collections more accessible by taking them from physical drawers to digital catalogs. To support their online collections, the Museum has developed specialized resources, like <a href=\"https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/inselect\">Inselect</a>—a cross-platform, open source desktop application that automates how scientists digitize specimens. Using Inselect, researchers can crop images from whole-drawer scans, as well as similar images generated by digitizing museum collections.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lqMwTToOojk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<h3><a href=\"#speeding-up-a-creepy-crawly-process\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"user-content-speeding-up-a-creepy-crawly-process\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Speeding up a creepy-crawly process</h3>\n<p>The museum initially developed Inselect for a simple purpose: to identify individual specimens from a drawer of samples in order to digitally categorize each.
