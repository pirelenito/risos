Now, with automation events, you can let your project boards update the status of your tasks for you. Whether you or a teammate add a new card to a project, close an issue, or merge a pull request, your cards will automatically move between columns in real time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/blog/2458-keep-your-project-boards-up-to-date-automatically\">Learn more about project board automation</a></p>\n<p>If you rely on assistive technology or prefer using the keyboard to manage project boards, you can now use our new <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/using-keyboard-shortcuts/#project-boards\">keyboard shortcuts</a> to quickly navigate between cards and columns.
